Overview

This project is a Python game built using the Pygame framework. The goal of the project was to create a functional 2D game where a player controls a spaceship to collect power cells and avoid asteroids. The purpose of building this game is to further my skills as a software engineer by learning how to implement game loops, object movement, collision detection, scoring, and difficulty scaling in a real-time environment.

The project started with simple Python code, where I imported pygame and printed "You better work" to see if pygame was correctly installed, and gradually expanded into a fully interactive game. The learning process involved understanding how graphics, input handling, timers, and object interactions work in Pygame.

The completed project demonstrates my ability to structure code, manage game objects, integrate gameplay mechanics into a working program, and push pass overwhelming hardships with time management and other university obligations.

A demonstration of the software running and a walkthrough of the code can be found here:

Development Environment

Visual Studio Code – used to write and run Python code.

Python – programming language used to develop the game.

Pygame – Python library used for game development, handling graphics, input, and collisions.

Acknowledgements
